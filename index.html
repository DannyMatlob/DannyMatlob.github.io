            <h1>Discord Spellcast/Boggle Solver</h1>
            <p>This program was originally designed to solve the game of Spellcast on Discord, and later on 
              I discovered the game is generally called 5x5 Boggle. I applied OOP principles when creating this program,
              making sure to cleanly organize the code into classes that mesh cleanly with eachother. I divide the 5x5 grid
              into nodes and connect them together. Then I recursively search for combinations of words that I will match
              to a dictionary of actual words I store in a hashset. The program runs and accepts user input through the terminal.</p>

            <h1>Portfolio Website</h1>
            <p>You're actually looking at my portfolio website right now! This was my first time sitting down and applying my knowledge
              to build a website as cleanly as I could. It uses vanilla Javascript with CSS for all the animations and effects. I learned
              many things about the quirks of UI/UX development, and I hit many roadblocks that I managed to eventually overcome. My favorite
              part of this project was the particle system in the background which was done using OOP principles in Javascript.

            <h1>Asian American Studies Project</h1>
            <p>This project is my attempt at a text-based story game where the user follows the life of a vietnamese refugee and makes choices that 
              impact the outcome of the game. The challenge for this project was properly organizing all of the text and dialogue so that I don't 
              get lost. In order to implement choices, I had a 
              function that handles user input and simply returns a binary choice. I decided to make each dialogue option its own function so that
              the functions can call eachother all the way down the line until they hit the end of the story, all without ugly loops.
