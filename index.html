            <p>My name is Danny Matlob and I'm a Software Engineer based in San Jose, California. I am currently a third year student at
              San Jose State University, and I am interested in Machine Learning, Database Management, and Multi-threading. You can contact me at:

            <h1>Discord Spellcast/Boggle Solver</h1>
            <p>This program was originally designed to solve the game of Spellcast on Discord, and later on 
              I discovered the game is generally called 5x5 Boggle. I applied OOP principles when creating this program,
              making sure to cleanly organize the code into classes that mesh cleanly with eachother. I divide the 5x5 grid
              into nodes and connect them together. Then I recursively search for combinations of words that I will match
              to a dictionary of actual words I store in a hashset. The program runs and accepts user input through the terminal.</p>

            <h1>Portfolio Website</h1>
            <p>You're actually looking at my portfolio website right now! This was my first time sitting down and applying my knowledge
              to build a website as cleanly as I could. It uses vanilla Javascript with CSS for all the animations and effects. I learned
              many things about the quirks of UI/UX development, and I hit many roadblocks that I managed to eventually overcome. My favorite
              part of this project was the particle system in the background which was done using OOP principles in Javascript.

            <h1>Phishing/Spam Machine Learning</h1>
            <p>
              Led a five person team through the development and training of two machine learning models that identify
              legitimate and illegitimate websites and emails with 95% and 85% accuracy respectively.
              Organized and prepared up to 10000 row datasets for training with a Random Forest Classifier (Both Models).
              Parsed website features for use in prediction via BeautifulSoup python library.

            <h1>MVC Framework</h1>
            <p>This project is a framework that helps to write applications using the Java Swing framework.
              It follows the Model-View-Controller design pattern which allows for relatively simple customizations
              of the framework to be made. Some of the customizations I have written include Minefield, which is
              a twist on the popular Minesweeper game, and Simstation, which is another framework built upon
              the MVC framework to allow for easy simulations.

            <h1>AngularJS/GraphQL Sandwich Stock</h1>
            <p>The frontend is written in AngularJS and accepts user input using dropdown menus for sandwich
               ingredients. Those ingredients are used to send queries to the backend, which runs GraphQL, 
               and returns how much of that ingredient remains in stock. This helped me gain experience in 
               creating custom directives, services, and filters, as well as working with AngularJS's routing 
               and data-binding capabilities. I now also understand how to write queries, mutations, and 
               subscriptions, as well as how to develop a GraphQL backend.
