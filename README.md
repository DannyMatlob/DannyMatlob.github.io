# portfolioWebsite

This was my first time sitting down and applying my knowledge to build a website as cleanly as I could. It uses vanilla Javascript with CSS for all the animations and effects. I learned many things about the quirks of UI/UX development, and I hit many roadblocks that I managed to eventually overcome. My favorite part of this project was the particle system in the background which was done using OOP principles in Javascript.
